## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StartupListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Startup` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a startup).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Startup` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStartupList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Startup` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Startup>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Startup` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Startup` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find Commands
The find commands allows users to find the startups with matching names, funding stages, or industries.
There are three find commands in CapitalConnect: `find n/`, `find i/`, `find f`. The implementation of these three commands are similar. Here we use the `find n/` command to illustrate how they are executed.

#### Find by Name
The `find n/` function allows users to find the startups that contain the names that users are interested in.

This function will display startup cards that have the same name as users provide. The startup card contains information other than the startup names, such as addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc..

To find the wanted startup, a `NamesContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created to test whether a startup has a name that matches the user's input keywords. Similarly, `find f/` and `find i/` will create `FundingStageContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `InudstryContainsKeywordsPredicate` respectively. These commands only change the displayed list of startups, stored as `filteredStartups` in `Model`, without affecting the data stored in CapitalConnect.

A typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a command to find startups by names, e.g. `find n/Apple`.
2. The input is passed to the `AddressbookParser` class which calls `FindCommandParser`. `FindCommandParser` attempts to parse the flags present, and in this case is `n/`. Note that `FindCommandParser` does not check invalid inputs like partial keywords. `FindCommandParser` will only throw an exception if the keyword is empty.
3. If the parse is successful, a `NamesContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created to find the startups that contain the name `Apple`.
4. A new `FindCommand` is created from the predicate and passed back to `LogicManager`.
5. The command is executed. The `filteredStartups` is updated with the predicate passed into the command.
6. The command result is created and passed back to the `LogicManager`

The following sequence diagram illustrates the execution process of a find by name command.

<puml src="diagrams/FindByName.puml" alt="FindByName" />

### Add Person Command
The add person command allows users to add key employees' information into a startup.

The key employee information will be displayed in the people pane, next to the startup card view. Through this function, users can keep track of employees' name, email, and other related information.

A typical program flow is as follows:
1. User enters a command to add a key employee to the first startup, e.g. `add-p 1 pn/John pe/johndoe@example.com pd/founder`.
2. The input is passed to the `AddressbookParser` class which calls `AdderPersonCommandParser`, and then the `AddPersonCommandParser` parses the keywords from the user's input.
3. The `AddPersonCommandParser` checks whether all required fields are entered and whether the index is valid. If all checks are passed, the program will move onto `AddPersonCommand`.
4. If the key employee does not exist in the startup, the startup's employee information will then be updated to include the new person.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of execution of an add person command.

<puml src="diagrams/AddPerson.puml" alt="AddPerson" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th startup in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/CapitalConnect â€¦â€‹` to add a new startup. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the startup was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the startup being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

Team size: 4

1. Limit length of startup name: Currently we do not limit length of startup name user can input. This
results in overflow. We plan to address this in the future by limiting length of startup names to 32 letters long.

2. Supporting country codes: Currently we do not allow users to specify country codes using "-", this makes it hard to track
international numbers. We plan to allow for the user to add an optional country code field alongside the phone number in further iterations.

3. Limit phone numbers: Currently we do not limit the length of phone numbers users can input. This may result in a UI overflow.
We plan to address this in the future by limiting the length of the phone number to 8 digits for the number and 3 digits for the country code after planned enhancement 2 has been completed.

4. Supporting non-alphanumerical characters in startup names: Some company names may contain non-alphanumerical characters. We plan to address this in the future by allowing for such characters to be in the name,
but also changing the current regular expression rules to ensure that the input remains valid.

5. Supporting non-alphanumerical characters in tags: Currently tags must be in alphanumerical characters without spacings. This forces users to find alternative means to add tags, such as using camel case within their tags instead. For example,
`US based` would not be an allowed tag, resorting in users tagging the startup as `USBased` instead. We plan to address this in the future by allowing for such characters to be in the tag,
but also changing the current regular expression rules to ensure that the input remains valid.

6. Display Index for Notes: Currently, Notes displayed in the UI do not indicate their index, making identifying them for editing/deleting difficult. We plan to support this for a future iteration.

7. Delete All Notes Feature: Currently, Notes need to be deleted one by one, which may be troublesome for users who want to organise and clear their startup information quickly. We plan to support this in a future iteration.

8. Limited types of funding stage: Currently, we only support traditional funding stages, so inputs for `FUNDING_STAGE` should be either `S`, `PS`, `A`, `B` or `C` in order to find a matching startup. `A`, `B`, `C` represents the respective funding series whilst `PS` refers to pre-seed and `S` refers to the seed stage. Please take note that inputs other than the ones mentioned above will also be accepted, but zero matching startups will be listed.

9. Supporting partial matching in find commands: We understand that you might want to use partial matching to find matching startups, but this feature is currently under development. This feature will be dropped soon!

10. Potential limitation in detecting duplicated persons: Note that duplicated persons in one startup are detected by `pe/EMAIL`. We assume that email is unique for every person. In other words, we assume that it is possible to have 3 Johns in one company, and they all have different emails. Before adding a new person to the startup, always double-check their email to make sure that the person is not added already. Also take note that we allow one person to work in multiple startups.
